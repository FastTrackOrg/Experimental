# Experimental tools

This repository regroups experimental tools for FastTrack that are under implementation and testing. They can be prototypes or tests, in C++ or Python.
They can be one day included in the FastTrack software or be release as CLI tools. They need a valid installation of fasttrack-cli to run.
